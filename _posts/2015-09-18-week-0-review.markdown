description: The moment in which I decide to change my fate.

On Sunday, September 13th, I was flipping out. I was depressed, anxious, scared, angry, and just kinda fed up with things. I have spent the last year and a half working for a cool startup out of SF called [Sqwiggle](http://www.sqwiggle.com). A few months ago, we pivoted, dismissed more than half the team, and started working on [Speak](https://speak.io/). It's been awesome, but stressful, as all startups are.

What I realized was, I'm pushing hard at Sqwiggle and Speak, but there's something missing. I feel that I've done a decent job becoming a good developer, but there's a side of entrepreneurship I just don't understand from my time in startups and tech consulting. I've decided to spend some time running experiments to discover what markets exist and how to access them. I'm going to be turning the way I've seen startups done in the past on their head, one little bit at a time, and documenting what works and what doesn't here.

Stay tuned.
