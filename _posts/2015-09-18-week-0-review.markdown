description: My #fuckit moment, what I'm doing next, and why
---

On Sunday, September 13th, I was flipping out. I was depressed, anxious, scared, angry, and just kinda fed up with things. I have spent the last year and a half working for a cool startup out of SF called [Sqwiggle](http://www.sqwiggle.com). A few months ago, we pivoted, dismissed more than half the team, and started working on [Speak](https://speak.io/). It's been awesome, but stressful, as all startups are. I felt like I wasn't producing at the level they needed due to burnout. The week before hadn't been very productive, as I was banging my head on some large problems, and generally getting nowhere fast.

After a long talk with my lovely and patient wife Karen, I called up my boss and chatted with him about dropping to half time in order to recover. It turns out this would buy them a couple more months, and he was up for giving it a try. I'll still be handling as much as I can during my afternoons, but I'll be off in the mornings. Right now we're treating it as an experiment.

I'll now have time to catch up on the personal stuff I've let slide over the last 3+ years of hard work. It'll be a good thing. I'll also be starting a writing habit, which will hopefully turn into something interesting. We'll have to see. My main goals are to recover and to try to share what I've learned recently. How that's going to happen hasn't been decided yet.

Stay tuned.
