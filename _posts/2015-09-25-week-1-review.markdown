This week was spent doing a lot of thinking and reading about startups in general. Here's what I see a LOT:

1) Build a widget
2) Iterate on the widget
3) Attempt to sell the widget
4) Fail
5) Pivot
6) Fail

Repeat until running out of money.

So, that's what my experiments AREN'T going to do. I've decided to figure out the marketing, distribution, and audience before I tackle creating anything that I could sell. What's the next step? Market research. Lots of it. Here in I've discovered problem number one - I'm trained as a developer. I have no idea how to do product research. My job for next week will be to figure that out.
