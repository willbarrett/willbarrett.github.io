This week started where every good thing starts - at the library. Luckily, Baltimore has a kick-ass library. Their website is terrible, but the [Enoch Pratt Library](http://www.prattlibrary.org/) is very well stocked, and totally under-used by any business people I know. I went in on Monday morning and walked out 30 minutes later with 7 books on market research and marketing. This week I've read two. Neither were perfect, but now I've got a good idea of the kinds of questions I need to be asking, and the sorts of resources I should look at in order to figure out the answers.

Part of my free time this week was lost to a family matter, but I've gotten back on the horse near the end of the week, and am plowing on. Early next week will be the beginning of true market research. I'll also continue reading on market and marketing research. I hope to spend a few weeks in research mode, with the goal of deciding on a target market and a problem people are willing to pay to solve.
